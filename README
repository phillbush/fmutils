                                FMUtils

FMUtils are a set of POSIX scripts that implement some handy file
management utilities.  Each script has its respective manual page.

The scripts are the following.
• bulkrename: Bulk rename files with your text editor.
• pick:       Interactivelly select options.
• preview:    Generate text preview of a file to be used by lf(1) or ranger(1).
• skel:       Create a template file in the current directory.
• trash:      Move files to trash following XDG trash specification.
• untrash:    Remove files from trash following XDG trash specification.
• unpack:     Unarchive archived files (.zip, .rar, .tar.gz, etc).


§ Installation

First, edit ./config.mk to match your local setup.

Since FMUtils are just script, they do not need to be built.

By default, FMUtils are installed into the /usr/local prefix.  Enter the
following command to install FMUtils (if necessary as root).  This command
installs the scripts into the ${PREFIX}/bin/ directory, and the manual
pages into the ${MANPREFIX}/man1/ directory.

	make install


§ Running FMUtils

The following are examples of how to use FMUtils.

Bulk rename all files in the current directory:
	$ ls | bulkrename

Bulk rename all .jpg files in the ~/Downloads directory:
	$ bulkrename ~/Downloads/*.jpg

Pick can be used to interactivelly remove files with rm(1).  This
example is equivalent to `rm -i`, but can be used with other commands
that, unlike rm(1), does not provide a -i option.
	$ rm $(pick *)

The previous example rely on the condition that each filename does not
contain space on it.  The following example avoid this by using a
quotion option, such as -q on pick(1), and a pipe into xargs(1):
	$ pick -q * | xargs rm

Add the following line to your ~/.config/lf/lfrc to use preview(1) as
file previewer.
	set previewer preview

Move all .jpg files to trash:
	$ trash *.jpg

Remove all .jpg files from trash (the environment variable $TRASH is
supposed to have the path of the trash)
	$ untrash $TRASH/files/*.jpg

Extract the content of file.zip into your home directory.
	$ unpack file.zip $HOME
